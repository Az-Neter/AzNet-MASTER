Player Avatar = @  
@ = 40 in Hexadecimal  
40 in Hex = 1000 000 in Binary  
@ = Player HP (100,000 bits capable of being flipped)  
One flipped bit (1 > 0) = -1 HP  
  
  Since .zeed BIN is equivalent to its HP, player HP can also be a 'Binary'  
  ie. Language like 'Player Binary Corrupted' or 'Binary Conversion in Process' can be used when describing events.
