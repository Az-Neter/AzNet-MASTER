Can't get too convoluted
(Not too many items, etc)

All forks must be somewhat compatible

Anything that breaks should be patched with the minimal amount of interference with other code

AI should be restricted only by their users

User creations should be seamlessly integrated in a way that does not break any of the above limitations
