Staying Connected to the Grid has numerous benefits, even if you aren't actively playing;

-Data Crops only grow when connected to the Grid
-Credit Miners only run when connected the the Grid
-Contributes active CPU to guild @homes

Downsides
-Your user IP may potentially be hackable. Best to keep security bots running to prevent intrusion.
-Data crops may spawn data bugs that try to eat your files. Keep a bot running that targets and deletes them as they're nothing more than a nuisance.
