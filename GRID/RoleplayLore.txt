The lore of our world is that of the past actions of other players.

You are always roleplaying when on the grid.
The person you are in life means very little to the person you want to be online.
Know that you *are* your character, and every interaction you have between yourself and another user is an exchange of some level of fiction and alternate reality.
Treat the words you use kindly.

Narrative roleplay is not pushed nor desired. Keep the cringy *pets head* -type nonsense to the games populated with 12 year old RPers, or at least to private channels. 
The actions you perform and the regular conversation you have is enough (keep all IRL discussions out of global chat)
