For a .zeed to access the GRID, it must be fully sent to the server, thus leaving no copy of it on the users device.  
This prevents users from having two alternate copies of the same .zeed.

While on GRID, the .zeed looks like how it would in BIN, and its HEX is not editable (ie. it must be taken off server to edit)

.zeed apply their rules to one another and to players just as a player would while on GRID. 
All functions are replicated so everything a user can do a .zeed could.

No Hatching Protocol rules are applied to the .zeed while it is on grid and its user is logged in.
(The protocols ARE applied while the .zeed is inside of a users @home or Root Town.)

Instead, it remains as a static blob of pixels which can be altered based on the rules applied to it externally. The pixels are generated from its BIN.
The primary rule is 'Follow' which will tether a .zeed to a players @ on grid.
Players should be able to write their own GRID Protocols to perform various functions using training data from the .zeed to alter how they interact on grid.

A .zeed that is on GRID while its user is offline has its Hatching Protocols reenabled, allowing it to function autonomously.

.zeed that get lost because of this are sent beyond the Blackwall to live out their remaining existence. (done by admins or hunter players, NOT autonomously)

.zeed CAN eat eachother on grid, if their protocol allows for it. They can also engage in any type of combat their training data normally allows.
