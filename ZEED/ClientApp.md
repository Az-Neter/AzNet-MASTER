The client app is used to pull your .zeed off your device in order to perform online activities, like uploading to GRID or battling using the Combat System.

It should have a built in hexadecimal editor with pretty and retro UI, as well as a BIN viewer for watching what edits do to your .zeed in real time.

The BIN viewer will be a replica of the device UI with all the same functions (same as current qFlipper, basically)

Client app should allow backups and restoring .zeeds and firmware.

Should also allow recovery of SD cards in case of user-tampering (remember, some parts of the .zeed should not be easily editable without risking corruption)
