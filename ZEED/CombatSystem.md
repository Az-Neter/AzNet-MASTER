The Combat System (name WiP) is hosted as a user-run server with a public or local IP and port

The Client program connects to the combat server when specified with port and ip

Data is pushed from server to local client program; Server cannot be altered by client, client only shares data that already exists locally

Any numder of .zeed should be able to connect and choose targets and allies at will

Should integrate with Az-Run mail as well as allowing its own local-server mail with sync feature for commiting offline info to public

During combat damage is pushed to .zeed in real time

Server owner can set rules and alternate gamemodes

Should be able to leave combat easily and quicky by reacalling .zeed from network, with mechanics to prevent 'running away' or 'combat logging'
